# eRealistic Horror Graphics
> What this mod doing?

_Change graphic ingame. Post-Process, interface, textures, more of ingame resources._

>Where do you release this mod to publish?

_When this mod will be ready to deploy, huh?_

> Why no one else do that before you?

_I don't know something about it. But i will do._


<sub>Modification making absolutely new graphic, just like some horror like Outlast, Resident Evil or another popular phranshise.
Replace many textures ingame, you don't need to use another software like Texmod. Just download, put, and here we go.</sub>

### For now - modification on early stage. Watch news about it.
